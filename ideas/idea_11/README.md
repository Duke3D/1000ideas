# The barber review

Easy: barber shops review. Ratings of haircuts, shop look & feel, barbers, etc... A yelp devoted only to barber shops, for guys only! No girls allowed :P Users can review and give suggestions, just like a normal review website.

### PROs

* Easy to be monetized with paid reviews or sponsored content
* Hipsters are welcome and willing to spend their money/time!
* Barbershops are everywhere!
* Easy MVP. A WordPress is enough to start the website
* The review-website mechanism is proved to work, almost in every niche

### CONs

* How to get a bunch of content for the start? You can't start with an empty website
* You need moderation once it gets traction
* Users are not willing to change barbers often. I was with the same barber for 30 years. So they would not search for reviews or a hint to change their habits
* A relative small niche
* Too much competition in review-based websites
