# Casting news

Movies and tv castings news with an app that will notify you of events happening nearby or incoming events. You can have both a profile as actor and as a casting company. Advanced profiles can include skill requested or body types, so you can filter for what you think you fit.

### PROs

* A must have for wannabe actors!
* Easy to monetize with a subscription and advanced services for tv or movie companies interested in castings
* Apart from Hollywood, probably the niche is worth investing
* Easy MVP with a website, then can scale up with apps and other services
* Can work also for Adult movies, if you know what I mean :-)
* Successfull stories can happen: serendipity++!
* Feedback system can help reviewing casting companies
* Go big, then be aquired!

### CONs

* Hard to gather info: really fragmented. Probably needs some sort of agent in the media/tv sector to gather fresh news
* Beware of scams! Castings should be verified someway
* Can work better in specific places like L.A., not everywhere
* Easy to be cloned, data can be scraped
* Some users can sign up for castings and not show. So if a company pays for the service, we should offer refunds
* Not a passive income source
