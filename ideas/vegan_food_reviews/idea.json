  "description": "There is a lot of vegan friendly food, clothes, restaurants, etc... out there, but not so many websites/youtube channels about food review. What's the best tofu? Are the veggies from X better than the veggies from Y? Reviews can be submitted by users or created by the staff.",
  "pros": [
    "Youtube channels for reviews are trendy nowadays",
    "Not so many alternatives in European market",
    "Easy to be monetized (paid reviews? ads?)",
    "Pretty and trendy niche",
    "Easy MVP. A WordPress is enough to start"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "I'm not vegan, I don't know any vegan. Staff should know what is ok or not for the vegan community",
    "Can be easy target for Internet trolls",
    "Easy to copy",
    "Needs a constant flow of new content everyday",
    "Hard to scale"
