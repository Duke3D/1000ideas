  "description": "An Uber for tech support. Computer isn't working? Can't configure your new iPhone? Call \"Uber for tech support\" and in a short time you can have a technician ringing your bell.",
  "pros": [
    "Can offer a great range of services, that can be monetize well...",
    "Disruptive? It should be easy to book a technician, just like UBER.",
    "Free/Discounted services if you're over 65? Could be a big benefit (serendipity++)",
    "Most of the problems are easy to solve if you can google it",
    "No competitor? Is this a \"PRO\"? :-)",
    "Market can be wide, but depends on services offered"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "What if something bad happens like data loss or similar?",
    "Hard to scale: needs to train or hire specifically trained people, background checks, etc...",
    "No MVP is possible, high setup costs for a good start. Start small, go big...",
    "Clones will popup soon",
    "Can work everywhere, but could work more in rich areas",
    "How big is the market for this? Probably won't work in Silicon Valley :-P",
    "How about hardware problems? Second appointment? Probably expensive..."
