# An Uber for simple tech support

An Uber for tech support. Computer isn't working? Can't configure your new iPhone? Call "Uber for tech support" and in a short time you can have a technician ringing your bell.

### PROs

* Can offer a great range of services, that can be monetize well...
* Disruptive? It should be easy to book a technician, just like UBER.
* Free/Discounted services if you're over 65? Could be a big benefit (serendipity++)
* Most of the problems are easy to solve if you can google it
* No competitor? Is this a "PRO"? :-)
* Market can be wide, but depends on services offered

### CONs

* What if something bad happens like data loss or similar?
* Hard to scale: needs to train or hire specifically trained people, background checks, etc...
* No MVP is possible, high setup costs for a good start. Start small, go big...
* Clones will popup soon
* Can work everywhere, but could work more in rich areas
* How big is the market for this? Probably won't work in Silicon Valley :-P
* How about hardware problems? Second appointment? Probably expensive...
