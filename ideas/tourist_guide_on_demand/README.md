# Tourist guide on demand for travel tips

Videocalls to answer about travel questions, made by locals. If I want to go and visit Italy I can pay a time token (i.e. 19$ for 1 hour) and chat with an italian asking questions about Milan, Rome, daily habits, etc...

### PROs

* MVP can start on Google Hangout with low tech involved
* You can connect with locals before your trip
* Makes people earn money thanks to their knowledge
* Can be used for more than travel tips: language lessons, etc...
* Can work live, but also "offline": I ask for a question and I receive a video answer later

### CONs

* Verification of locals identity and knowledge
* Good insurance is needed. What if a tourist is tricked by a local to make something dangerous or at worse into a robbery?
* Hard to scale
* Once not an MVP anymore you need some tech for video conferencing
* A money back guarantee should be offered
