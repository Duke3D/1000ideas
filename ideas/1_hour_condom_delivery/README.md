# 1 hour emergency condoms/sextoys delivery

The title says it all. Push "a button" and a pack of condom (or other funny things) will be delivered wherever you are within one hour, anonymous package will protect your privacy. Because safe sex is important, but you never know when and where it can happen.

### PROs

* Easy MVP with an app or mobile first website
* Can be expanded by offering 1 hour delivery on other products
* People are willing to pay for delivery
* Safety first! Then fun!
* No companies specialized in this, AFAIK

### CONs

* Can't really scale, competition is fierce, needs logistics, yes, I'm talking to you Amazon Prime!
* People are willing to pay for delivery, but price of products is so low that probably it's not feasible
* Will it really work for condoms or sexy stuff only?
* Can't really be branded or advertised while delivering like Deliveroo or Uber Eats. Privacy concerns
* Some items needs proper transportation (i.e. condoms)
