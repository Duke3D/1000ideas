  "description": "A website that creates a catalogue of picture of insides of secret places nobody has knowledge of. Example: Area 51, hidden offices of specific research fields, inside of pyramids not accessible by tourists, old WW2 bunkers, etc... Where possible the content should be verified",
  "pros": [
    "Nice niche to explore, interesting for many people",
    "The website can be as simple as a blog, even on free platforms",
    "Can be the next \"PostSecrets\" if steadily updated",
    "Content can become easily viral",
    "Content can be endless, if well organized"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Safety concerns, hello FBI/CIA/NSA! :-), but mostly legal involvements. Expect a lot of \"cease and desist\" letters",
    "Who can provide a constant flow of fresh content? Sources should stay anonymous",
    "Hard to monetize, probably sponsored content?",
    "https://www.reddit.com/r/HiddenDoor/ can be a competitor",
    "How to verify fake and hoaks??? Pretty impossible."
