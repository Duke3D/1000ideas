  "description": "A videogame about a fat programmer. He will jump (hard, because he's fat), trying to avoid programming books and other stuff falling from the screen. Bonuses will include nerd tshirts and other nerd stuff.",
  "pros": [
    "I always wanted to make a videogame, plus I'm a programmer. A fat programmer.",
    "Many platforms can be covered with the same code (Unity?)",
    "If successful can bring a lot of money in a short time",
    "People throws money into IAP and other videogames-related stuff",
    "Documentation and tools are almost free."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Videogames: an overcrowded environment to live in, even if money is spent in games more than ever. Could be a waste of time, very few succeed",
    "Hard to monetize with free2play models ruling the market",
    "Can hardly be made alone. A graphic and a sound designer should be involved for a quality product",
    "Piracy and clones from other devs are a big pain in the a*s, in my opinion",
    "Hard to make an MVP. Product should be at least in beta to be tested with users",
    "Probably needs high budget to be spent in marketing"
