# Play videogames meetup platform

Let's meet other people to play videogames together. And f*ck streaming! A community for videogame players that wants to be social, old school. Share what games you want to play on which platform and share your availability calendar for meetings.

### PROs

* Be social, like when we were kids
* Easy MVP, leveraging existing tools like meetup.com
* Can make partnerships with streaming services
* Leveraging 80s / 90s nostalgia
* Can gather easy sponsorship from videogames/consoles firms

### CONs

* Hard to organize
* Legal involvements for underage players. Bad things can happen
* Hard to scale
* Streaming is really cool these days, can we challenge it?
* Of course it's location based, so can't really work in small communities or isolated environments.
