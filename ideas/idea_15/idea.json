  "description": "A custom keyboard that will contain a set of predefined messages to be typed. Fully customizable will contain texts like \"I'll be there in 5 minutes\", \"LOL\", etc... So people can scroll and send messages at ease.",
  "pros": [
    "I need this, but I'm not able to find what I'm looking for in the alternative apps out there, but I'm bad at searching :P",
    "Easy to be made: iOS/Android are offering the right tools",
    "Can have an online community of people sharing their common messages",
    "People too can find it useful",
    "Multiplatform can be a plus, with cloud sync between devices/OS"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Easy to clone, devs!",
    "Hard to monetize: will people pay for that?",
    "Probably there are alternatives already and [in iOS you can create one in the system settings](http://heresthethingblog.com/2016/01/20/ios-android-create-keyboard-shortcuts/)",
    "No real value, if you're not used to send always the same messages like me",
    "Privacy concerns? Can be analytics used?"
