# Sandwiches recipe app

You just have some bread, some random ingredients and you're hungry. The app will mix&match your available ingredients to provide you a yummy recipe for a sandwich. Optionally you can tell the app you're vegan or you have allergies, so it can avoid some ingredients. Food can be divided into categories and rated by "delicious" points from the user.

### PROs

* Can be sponsored by a food brand, if gets traction
* Can be sold? Yes, but probably should offer IAPs and/or banners
* Easy MVP. Nothing new from a dev. point of view
* People love sandwiches!
* Could be social & viral by making users sharing their recipes

### CONs

* Build a list of ingredients can be hard, should provide barcode scan, but don't know where to start for nutrition data. Maybe paid services? [https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/api/doc](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/api/doc) is free, but what for other countries?
* We should deal carefully with allergies
* A good recipe should be tested extensively
* No way to monetize fast, IAPs are probably the only way it will work
* Idea is not new, there are already apps out there for meals
* Should provide a nice UI with pics, so stock pics should be used that can cost money
