# The brothels review

Brothels review, because probably there's a way to make people aware of other's experience, even in brothels. The mechanism is pretty simple. People can, under full anonymous coverage, leave review for girls/men services.

### PROs

* Easy to be monetized with paid reviews or sponsored content
* Cannot really find a competitor. Could be a good hint
* Brothels are everywhere! No, not really. But where brothels are, there are people willing to look for reviews
* Easy MVP. A WordPress is enough to start the website
* The review-website mechanism is proved to work, almost in every niche

### CONs

* Cannot really find a competitor. Could be a bad news
* Legal involvement? What about non legal brothels or single state laws?
* How to get a bunch of content for the start? You can't start with an empty website, and I can't really go to brothels
* In Italy prostitution is legal, but brothels are not
* You need moderation and verification
* A relative small niche
* Too much competition in review-based websites
* Cannot use regular advertising networks
