# Lost babies tattoo (or bracelet)

Before going to crowded places, put a tattoo (or bracelet) with your phone number on your children's arm. If he/she get lost somebody can call you and make your baby safe at home. This is not a new idea, but I found that the tattoo can be used extensively: probably with a few bucks you can get 10 tattoos or more. Bracelets can be "built on demand", or available with customizable numbers.

### PROs

* Makes kids safer
* No batteries needed!
* Can contain more info if needed, like specific medical conditions
* Suitable also for animals, very small children or adults with dementia or alzheimer, more in general you don't have to remember anything
* Not much technology involved

### CONs

* Can be used for social engineering: I see the number, I call the number, I can fake that something bad is happening
* Possibile allergies
* I wasn't able to find tattoo papers for cheap
* Not a new idea
* How to scale properly?
* GPS/RFID/NFC/whatever bracelets are already on the market with apps, etc...
