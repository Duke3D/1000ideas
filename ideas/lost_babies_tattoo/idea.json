  "title": "Lost babies tattoo (or bracelet)",
  "description": "Before going to crowded places, put a tattoo (or bracelet) with your phone number on your children's arm. If he/she get lost somebody can call you and make your baby safe at home. This is not a new idea, but I found that the tattoo can be used extensively: probably with a few bucks you can get 10 tattoos or more. Bracelets can be \"built on demand\", or available with customizable numbers.",
  "pros": [
    "Makes kids safer",
    "No batteries needed!",
    "Can contain more info if needed, like specific medical conditions",
    "Suitable also for animals, very small children or adults with dementia or alzheimer, more in general you don't have to remember anything",
    "Not much technology involved"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Can be used for social engineering: I see the number, I call the number, I can fake that something bad is happening",
    "Possibile allergies",
    "I wasn't able to find tattoo papers for cheap",
    "Not a new idea",
    "How to scale properly?",
    "GPS/RFID/NFC/whatever bracelets are already on the market with apps, etc..."
