  "title": "Let's build a website together!",
  "description": "A service that will help people (or small business) face 2 face in special \"shops\" (or remotely) in building a personal website. From choosing the hosting company and domain to the technology involved (WordPress, Jekyll, etc...). Not an agency, but side-by-side assistance",
  "pros": [
    "People wants to be on the Internet, but the barrier is still high for some people",
    "Easy to monetize. Hourly rate, \"Ã  la carte\", courses and classes",
    "Can be made in partnership with hosting companies",
    "Paid services can help the same service as a charity service for third world markets businesses that can't afford a proper webagency",
    "I can do that. And software like WordPress, Jekyll, etc... Are free!"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Doesn't scale easily, probably having shops is the best way. Can work then only in some specific markets",
    "People doesn't know what they want. What if they keep iterating on designs? Should we offer a design service or not? Maybe not",
    "In what this is different from a web agency?",
    "What about technology? Are open softwares like WordPress, Jekyll, OpenCart... Enough?",
    "Can't really be an MVP. Even if I can do that by myself"
