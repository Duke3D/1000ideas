  "title": "Take me home: \"bodyguard\" as a service",
  "description": "A bodyguard service that can be arranged like UBER. If for any specific reason I need a bodyguard or just somebody to take me home (or another place) safely, the service can provide trained people that will help me stay safe, even for a short amount of time. Example: I left my boyfriend and for a week I need somebody to bring me home at night in case I meet him.",
  "pros": [
    "Can offer a great range of services, that can be monetize well (drive me home, wait for me, etc...)",
    "Paid service can help an equal charity service for people in struggle. Serendipity++ This really could help a lot of people!",
    "Disruptive in a closed market: it should be easy to book, just like UBER. Today if I need this kind of service I don't even know where to look",
    "Pay-to-go or monthly subscriptions can be offered, enlarging the audience",
    "The market has already proved that services like this can work."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Can be hard to match local regulation on bodyguard services, depending on the country or even state",
    "What if something bad happens? Probably high insurance costs, bad press, legal struggles, etc...",
    "Hard to scale: needs to train or hire specifically trained people, background checks, etc...",
    "No MVP is possible, high setup costs for a good start. Start small, go big...",
    "Clones will popup soon, and a price war on people's safety is not good",
    "Can work everywhere, but could work more in rich areas",
    "What if somebody needs a bodyguard and I can't provide one for whatever reason?"
