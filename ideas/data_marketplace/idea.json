  "description": "A place where you can sell and buy any form of raw data. Websites analytics data, geodata, measurements, medical data, etc... In many formats (csv, json, etc...) would be available for students, researches, and institutions to be \"crunched\" and derive analysis.",
  "pros": [
    "Subscription or \"per package\" pricing model, can be very flexible",
    "Public sector can be primary client",
    "Many data are freely available, with licenses that allow to sell them",
    "Big data are the shit now! :-P",
    "Can also sell analysis instead of raw data"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Data should be stored safely: piracy and data breach can be problematic",
    "How to ensure data are anonymous and true? How to verify fake data?",
    "There are many free and open data repositories available",
    "Storage prices can be high. BIG DATA ARE BIG! :-)",
    "Licensing of data to be sold are cumbersome. Legal team needed"
