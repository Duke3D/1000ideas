# Survive the office: a manual

A manual to survive your 9 to 5 job with tips, tricks and strategies to be applied in the professional environment. Should be written as a funny manual and with a good dose of sarcasm.

### PROs

* Sharing is caring: tricks build in years and years of experience are probably worthy to be shared
* Probably a bestseller. LOL
* Can be self-published on many platforms, and earn some money anyway
* Can't really find a similar book
* I want to write a book before I die

### CONs

* Probably should be written with a fake name
* Never wrote a book, don't know how to start or keep organized
* My english is good, but not perfect. Limited to the italian language and professional translations are not cheap
* No way to forecast earnings. It's 2016 and nobody reads anymore in Italy
* No time to write, can take longer
