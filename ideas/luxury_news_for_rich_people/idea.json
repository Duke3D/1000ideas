  "description": "Reach people have no time. They want to be updated in a fast way. They want to show-off. So here's the idea: a super simple app that will update about watches, boats, supercars, private jets, but also world news... Like tinder, it will show an headline, a pic and some info. Swipe left if you are ok with the headline or right to get more info. If interested can be expanded. All for a 99$ / month subscription, because you're rich, you want the best.",
  "pros": [
    "High price subscription can work as a \"status symbol\", and make you some good money",
    "Tinder like flow is proved to work, nothing new to add",
    "Can be partially automated, i.e. world news can come from external sources",
    "Can easily scale, if it gets traction",
    "I'm italian, I can easily reach many of the luxury brands to get news from the source",
    "If successfull, can make really good money in advertising"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Needs a full team for fresh news",
    "Hard to differentiate, if news are always the same.",
    "How to get exclusive news, for example in fashion",
    "Can't really cover international events. I need to be rich to cover news for the rich people",
    "Probably also need a way to avoid plagiarism of original content"
