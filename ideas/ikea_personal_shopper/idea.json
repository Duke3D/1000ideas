  "description": "A personal shopper that will help you design your home and will buy with you the items you need @ Ikea. Meet at home, take measures and discuss design choices, go to shop together.",
  "pros": [
    "Many people likes IKEA but have zero knowledge of taking measures or design their home. IKEA tools are far from perfect.",
    "Can be a second job for many people (including myself)",
    "IKEA is everywhere",
    "Personal shoppers for clothes are a thing. Why not furniture?",
    "MVP easy to be created (launch page, plus calendar)"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Ikea can easily replicate the service or find a way to fight against it.",
    "Must be cheap",
    "How to set contract? How about the user not satisfied with final results?",
    "Additional services like transportation and assembly are already sold by Ikea itself.",
    "Hard to scale.",
    "Staff needs some basic knowledge of how to take measures and/or home design"
