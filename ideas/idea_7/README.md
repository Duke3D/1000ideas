# CV Bot

A facebook messenger/telegram/whatever bot for your CV, people can ask questions and send contact requests. Can be based on AI or just be a wizard about your CV

### PROs

* Bots are the s*it nowadays
* If you are a programmer you can show your coding skills with your bot
* Easy to be implemented "as a service" for people that can't code with a freemium pricing model
* If coded properly can be easily extended to other platforms in order to manage multiple bots (telegram, whatsapp, etc...) in the future with the same codebase
* Opensource tech already available, easy to create an MVP at no cost
* Can be integrated with AI as a service for more complex answers or can stick to Question/Answer model

### CONs

* http://olabot.com/ by Chris Messina is already working on it
* Only complimentary to your real CV
* Probably only suitable for tech related CVs
* AI integration can be cumbersome
* How to track interactions with the bot? Not all platforms offer analytics
