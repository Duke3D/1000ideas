  "title": "Follow me luggage",
  "description": "A luggage with a little engine, sensors (gps, ultrasounds, etc...) and bluetooth connection that will follow you everywhere, so you don't have to carry it around. Powered with a little electric engine, the luggage will be managed via an app on your smartphone that will ring if it goes lost or out of reach.",
  "pros": [
    "No more luggage to be carried!",
    "Perfect target for a Kickstarter campaign",
    "Cheap MVP: not complex to be made with current technology, pocket size",
    "If well engineered can be applied to already own luggage",
    "Useful for disabled people or people with limited capacities"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Transport regulation can limit usage",
    "Additional weight for parts and engine, even if pocket-sized",
    "Cant' follow on every terrain, or limited weight capacity",
    "Needs partnership with suitcases creator for commercial availability",
    "Will people pay for the additional cost?"
